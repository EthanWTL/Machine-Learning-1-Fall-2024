## a. Probability, Odds, Log-Odds
Here is a quick comparision between three terms.
| Terminology  | Description | Equation |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------|
| Probability | The probability that an event happens |  $p$ |
| Odd (Odd of success)  | Probability of success / Probability of failure | $\frac{p}{1-p}$ |
| Log-Odds | logarithm of the odds | $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ |

## b. Logistic Regression
Log Odds provides an alternate expression for logistic regression

 $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$
